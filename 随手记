searching and replacing
- simple literal patterns
str.replace(origin, substitute)
- complex patterns like date substitution
import re
re.sub(original pattern, target pattern, str)
in order to get how many be substituted
re.subn(original pattern, target parttern, str)
and we can simply print n to get the number
